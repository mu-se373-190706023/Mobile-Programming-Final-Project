# EMERGENCY APPLICATION
## OVERVIEW

* **Goal:** Have people comfortable to make a request to '_Emergency Services_'. In this case we have seen that in some times peoples having difficulties to explain the situation which they facing. Our ultimate aim is to eliminate this problem with increase the ability of uploading resource such as image, video or voice. As i thought when a woman walks down then street and some man follows her, she probably be afraid of that. In this situation she may have to call the police, but without the other man noticing.
