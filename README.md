# EMERGENCY APPLICATION
## OVERVIEW

* **Goal:** Our goal is to provide a service to people comfortably make requests to '_Emergency Services_'. We have seen that in some cases people having difficulties explaining the situation they are faced. Our ultimate aim is eliminate this problem with enhencing the ability of uploading resource such as image, video or voice. As i thought when a woman walks down the street and some man follows her, she would probably be afraid of that. In this situation she may have to call the police, but without the other man noticing.
